### ðŸ›° Radar Simulation (Python)
A radar-style object detector using math and `if/else` conditions. This project helps understand object tracking, geometry, and decision making in programming.

### ðŸ”º Pascal Triangle Generator
Generated Pascalâ€™s Triangle using `for` loops. Itâ€™s useful for learning mathematical patterns and loop logic.
